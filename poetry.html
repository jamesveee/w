            <h3>Text 1</h3>
            <p>On a terrible and frightening Earth, you provide me with solace with your love. The way the night is enrobed in its velvety darkness is the way I love you completely. Love was always like a distant planet, taunting me with demotivating whispering, teasing and admonishing me against searching, while galavanting and slow dancing with other planets. Suddenly, you supernova, you come along and sunder all despair and hopelessness and you light my sky with impossible colours and decimate all uncertainty in love. The love that we have is the love that I was always jealous of in other people. I thought to myself that I would never have that and that perhaps I am simply just undeserving of that kind of love. But now, the way I love you is the way that I am certain that when I open my eyes, I can see. The way I love you is the way that my heart is certain that it needs to keep beating for me to survive. You are like the most gorgeous melody ever written, and together, we are a perfect harmony. You are unequivocally the soul that I have searched for since I understood that I must find love. You make me want to wear my poets hat so I can try and put my love into perspective. My heart sings eternal songs for you, my brain interprets what it can and my bumbling fingers tries to parse out the best. When I say that I miss you, I mean that I miss you like I am writing you a letter because I have gone off to war and might never see you again.</p>

            <p>The most common words in my head<p></p> 
            <p>Are 
            <p>I, miss, love & her 
            <p></p>    
            <p>The rest of my thoughts are consumed
            <p></p>with finding out ways to transmute
            <p></p>those common & mundane words
            <p></p>into deliberate phrases
            <p></p>that are poignant, eloquent and affecting
            <p></p> 
            <p></p>I want to make it so known to you
            <p></p>that these words repeating incessantly
            <p></p>are the most common words in my head</p>

            <p>I could never dream again and it wouldnâ€™t change a thing. Philosophers say the sublime is beyond any possibility of calculation or imitation, so that leads me to say that our love is sublime. It is impossible to be quantified in any reality or universe and can only be compared to the vastness of the universe and the heavens. He willed our love out of nothingness. When our beings are broken down, we are just two souls experiencing the world around us, and it is a miracle that on our separate journeys and the separate paths that God carved out for us that we would meet and our souls would connect and synchronize in the way that they have. You have turned my hopelessness into a state yearning when I donâ€™t have you around anymore. The longing I feel for the 96 or so hours after leaving you for the week is intense and visceral like a punch to the gut. Every time I wake up and youâ€™re not next to me, I would prefer to stay asleep until I see you again.</p>

            <p> You are a great big bouquet of roses of every colour, you are the sunshine peaking through clouds on a gloomy day. You mean everything to me and I cannot imagine a world where you and I are not together. You are the greatest person for me, you are my best friend, my confidant, the person whose opinion means the most. You are so important and special to me and no one would be ever able to replace you and I am grateful and appreciative of the love that you give me. I know that I can be a handful, weird and goofy but you never get too annoyed at me. You are attentive to my needs, you understand what I like and what I dont like, you give me rides while I work on getting my license, you are honest and open with me, youâ€™re willing to try new things in the bedroom, youâ€™re just amazing in every way. Youâ€™re the best. Before you, my heart was just an empty and dry plot of land, but now that you are in my life, what was once empty and dry has been replaced with the most gorgeous, fruitful and sprawling garden that anyone has ever seen. You are truly the love of my life, and without your love, living would be futile. Dramatic, I know, but thats how I feel. You are courageous and respectful, brave and understanding, loving and caring, god fearing and  intelligent, not to mention, the most gorgeous and sexy woman I have ever seen. I really enjoy sending these long paragraphs to you and finding new ways to tell you just how much I love you. I never used to like pda, but with you I want everyone to see us kiss. I want everyone to know just how much I love you. I am (fervently) excited for our future together, and I love you with all my heart and soul. We are a forever thing. I am overjoyed with the fact that you and I are together and as in love as we are and I am proud of how far weâ€™ve come not just as a couple, but also as individuals. You are my beautiful princess, my lil bunny, my sweet angel, and all I want is for you to feel loved. Thank you for being you.</p>

        <p>From your second birthday that we spent together:
            <p>Lil bunny,</p> 

            Itâ€™s the second birthday that Iâ€™ve had the pleasure of being a part of and I cant wait to spend all the rest of them with you. Since we started dating, I have learned so much about myself and I learned how to be a better man along the way. Never in a billion years would I believe that I could find a woman like you, someone who is so sweet and caring, scarily intelligent, raucously hilarious, so lovely, outlandishly beautiful, and sexy beyond measure. I love spending time with you, so much so that I wish I could transform every single blade of grass on Godâ€™s green Earth into more time to spend with you. Iâ€™ve had the most amazing time with you these past couple of years and I wouldnâ€™t trade it for anything in the universe. The money I spent on these gifts is not even close to the money that I would spend on you if I could. I truly wish I could give you the world, if I could gift every single star in our night sky to you, I would. I cherish every single moment that we spend together, even when things get a little tough. I appreciate you so much! Youâ€™re my best friend and my person and I am ecstatic to one day call you my wife. Happy Birthday my beautiful princess!!!

        <p>From when you were going through a rough time:</p>
        <p>I miss you baby and Iâ€™m sorry that youâ€™re going through a rough time so I decided to write you a paragraph about how much I love you. I think about you constantly, whenever I feel a warm breeze, whenever I listen to music, whenever I watch TV, whenever I do anything at all, I think of you. The way I love you is like breathing, itâ€™s necessary for my survival and satisfies me. Youâ€™re like the deepest and most satisfying sigh. Even when youâ€™re upset with me, I miss you like crazy. I love everything about you, blindly. There is no one on earth that Iâ€™d rather be with, thereâ€™s nothing that I would trade for what we have. Youâ€™re the greatest in bed, youâ€™re the funniest person I know, youâ€™re everything Ive ever wanted in a partner and Im beyond excited for our future together. Youâ€™re the person I talk to the most, the person whose opinion matters most, the person that I want to handle the most carefully, the person that helps me be a better me. The time I spend with you is never enough, I always crave more and more of you and I can never keep my hands to myself when youâ€™re around me. I trust you so much and that in itself is crazy for me because Ive never had this much trust in a partner. I wish I could take away all your anxiety and stress about the things you think about, I wish I could remove all those things that haunt you and put them on me instead. I love you more than anything in the world and it hurts me to see you be hurt. I love you my lil bunny.</p>
