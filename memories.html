                <p>The day we first met. I still remember the feeling of excitement and nervousness when I saw you for the first time! I wish I could have been more of a gentlemen, I wish that all the time. But I promise that I will always try my best to treat you like the princess that you are, because you deserve it and I love you more than anything in the world</p>

                <p>Our first date at a restaurant. It was Super Burger, and I was extremely nervous. Even though we were already dating, I feel like that was the actual first date that I had with you. You were looking so beautiful that night, and I could not believe that you were still giving me a chance after "the incident". </p>
            </div>
            <div class="memory-card">
                <p>Watching a thunderstorm looking out your window. I don't know what it was about that moment, but it is something that I will cherish until I die. Maybe it was the fact that we were both living in the moment and nothing thinking about anything else. We were just enjoying each others company and watching nature.</p>

            <div class="memory-card">
                <p>Our first Christmas together. Exchanging gifts and spending the holiday with you was the coziest experience I could have ever had, even if it was a little bit shy at first. You got me a speaker that I still use till this day! It was also the first time that I was allowed to sleep over at your house. Remember when your dad didn't want me to sleep over? HAHAHA, now I spent almost the entire summer at your house!! I can't wait to spend every Christmas with you!! When I have actual money, I will treat you every holiday. I will get you anything that you desire, because you are simply incredible. </p>
            </div>
            <div class="memory-card">
                <p>Our first Anniversary. We went to a hotel together, I broke stuff by accident, we had sex, we drank champagne, we took a bath together, I made the wrong reservations so we went to another restaurant that was mostly empty and you ordered something you didn't like very much. You were jealous of the couple that was sitting near us because they got a booth and were sitting together all comfy. I really wish that we stole their seat. Even though things didn't necessarily go to plan that night, I was happy just to be with you and to celebrate with you and to make new memories. To many more anniversaries!!  </p>
            </div>
            <div class="memory-card">
                <p>The time that we went to Noire & Blanche together, recently. We both walked there, we ate some food and drank some sangria and walked back home. We took pictures together and simply enjoyed each others company. We're at a point in our relationship that we are so comfortable with each other and I wouldn't trade it for the world </p>
            </div>
            <div class="memory-card">
                <p>Every single time I've given you an orgasm. Every time that I've done that for you, I feel like a new man. I want to do that for you all the time for the rest of our lives, it is SO addictive to me. You are so addictive, it's unbelievable.  </p>

                <p>When you got your wisdom teeth taken out. I loved taking care of you and giving you your little dilaudids LMAO. After that, it seems that it started a pattern of doing things for you, but I really don't care. I'll prepare any pill, fill up your water bottle with ice and water 123789529918494208942093 times, give you rubs and head pets, put aloe vera on your sun burns, tuck you in, give you hugs, I'll do anything for you ((I mean I made this dumb website LMAO )) I do not care because I truly love you with all of my heart!!! </p>
